This is a reupload of an old mod that was hosted on the now-defunct Bioware Social Network. 

Didn't see it hosted anywhere else and luckily I still had it in an old backup drive, figured it would be helpful to make it available again. Sadly, I don't know who the mod author is so I can't give him proper credit. Let me know if you know who it is.

Original ReadMe follows:

===================
=Less Tedious Fade=
===================

Places a "Mysterious Tome" near the start of the Fade portion of the "Broken Circle" quest, 
after the sloth demon puts the player to sleep. Reading it grants all four 
shapeshifting forms immediately.

That way you won't have to backtrack every time you learn a new form.

You'll find it right after you learn the Mouse form, next to the first Mouse Hole.

Please report any problems by commenting or starting a discussion on the project:

That's also where to find the latest version.

-------------
INSTALLATION: 
-------------

In your C:\Games\Dragon Age\bin_ship directory (if you installed the game to your games
folder, your installation path may vary), there should be a file called daupdater.exe.

Run that file.
Click "Select DAZIPs."
Select "LessTediousFade.dazip" from wherever you saved it.
Click on it on the list.
Click "Install Selected."
When complete (it won't take long) exit the program.

Once in the game, visit "Installed Content" and ensure the mod's box is checked.
